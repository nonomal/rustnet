  <em>Real-time visibility into every connection your machine makes, who owns it, and what protocol it's speaking. No tcpdump, X11 forwarding, or root piping.</em>
</p>

## Features

- **Per-process attribution**: Every TCP, UDP, and QUIC connection mapped to its owning process, via eBPF on Linux, PKTAP on macOS, ETW with an automatic IP Helper fallback on Windows, and native APIs on FreeBSD. Details include PID, executable, user/group names, match confidence, and a capped parent-process chain on every platform. Wireshark and tcpdump can't do this; `netstat` / `ss` can't show live state.
- **Deep packet inspection**: Identify HTTP, HTTPS/TLS with SNI, DNS, SSH, FTP, QUIC, MQTT, BitTorrent, WireGuard, OpenVPN, STUN, NTP, mDNS, LLMNR, DHCP, SNMP, SSDP, and NetBIOS, without external dissectors.
- **Annotated PCAPNG export**: `--pcapng-export` writes a Wireshark-ready capture with process, PID, direction, DPI/SNI, and GeoIP embedded as per-packet comments. Open it in Wireshark and every packet already names its owning process, with no post-processing. Classic `--pcap-export` with a JSONL sidecar for offline correlation is also available.
- **Security sandboxing**: Landlock (Linux 5.13+), Seatbelt (macOS), token privilege drop + job-object child-process block (Windows). Drops privileges immediately after libpcap initializes. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Network analytics**: Real-time round-trip times for TCP, QUIC handshakes, DNS responses, and ICMP echo, plus TCP retransmission, out-of-order, and fast-retransmit detection. Protocol-aware health badges surface TCP issues, explicit QUIC Retry/version events, and retries/timeouts for transaction-based UDP, with severity-first sorting in the Overview table.
- **Smart connection lifecycle**: Protocol-aware timeouts; idle rows get a yellow-to-red stripe and removal countdown and soften toward gray. Toggle `t` to keep historic (closed) connections visible for forensics.
- **Vim/fzf-style filtering**: `port:`, `src:`, `dst:`, `sni:`, `process:`, `state:`, `proto:`, plus regex via `/(?i)pattern/`.
- **GeoIP enrichment**: Country lookups via local MaxMind GeoLite2. No network calls.
- **LAN device identification**: MAC address and vendor (from the embedded IEEE OUI database) for on-link peers and the gateway, learned passively from ARP traffic and shown in the details pane.
- **Kubernetes attribution** (optional `kubernetes` feature): connections mapped to their pod, namespace, and container, shown in the details pane, JSON/PCAPNG exports, and the `pod:`, `ns:`, `container:` filters. Enabled in the official Docker image; on a cluster, use the [kubectl-rustnet](https://github.com/domcyrus/kubectl-rustnet) plugin to run it as an ephemeral debug pod. See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md#--kubernetes-mode-optional-feature).
- **Cross-platform**: Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD.

## Why RustNet?

RustNet fills the gap between simple connection tools (`netstat`, `ss`) and packet analyzers (`Wireshark`, `tcpdump`):

- **Process attribution**: See which application owns each connection. Wireshark cannot provide this because it only sees packets, not sockets.
- **Connection-centric view**: Track states, bandwidth, and protocols per connection in real-time
- **SSH-friendly**: TUI works over SSH so you can quickly see what's happening on a remote server without forwarding X11 or capturing traffic

RustNet complements packet capture tools. Use RustNet to see *what's making connections*. For direct Wireshark inspection, `--pcapng-export` writes live best-effort packet comments with PID/process context. For cleanup-time correlation, use `--pcap-export` plus the JSONL sidecar and optional `scripts/pcap_enrich.py`. See [PCAP Export](USAGE.md#pcap-export) and [Comparison with Similar Tools](ARCHITECTURE.md#comparison-with-similar-tools) for details.

Built on ratatui, libpcap, eBPF (libbpf-rs), DashMap, crossbeam, ring, MaxMind GeoLite2, and Landlock. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#dependencies) for the full dependency breakdown.

<details>
<summary><b>eBPF Enhanced Process Identification (Linux Default)</b></summary>

RustNet uses kernel eBPF programs by default on Linux for enhanced performance and lower overhead process identification.

**Process Names:**
- eBPF records the process group leader's TGID and `comm` name (a kernel field limited to 16 characters) rather than the acting thread's name, so multi-threaded applications show the main process name instead of thread names like "Socket Thread"
- RustNet then re-resolves the current name via `/proc/<tgid>/comm`, recovers comm-truncated names from the executable's file name (e.g. "chromium-browse" becomes "chromium-browser"), and resolves the full executable path shown in the Details view
- Short-lived processes that exit before this enrichment runs keep the eBPF-recorded 16-character name

**Fallback Behavior:**
- On Linux 5.11 and newer, a one-shot BPF task-file iterator inventories sockets that were already open at startup, including sockets owned by root and other users when RustNet runs with file capabilities
- When eBPF fails to load or lacks sufficient permissions, RustNet automatically falls back to standard procfs-based process identification
- Older kernels and procfs-only builds resolve names through procfs scanning, which has higher CPU overhead and can only inspect socket owners visible to the RustNet user
- eBPF is enabled by default; no special build flags needed

To disable eBPF and use procfs-only mode, build with:
```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features
```

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical information.

<details>
<summary><b>Process Activity and Host Monitoring</b></summary>

RustNet combines process-level traffic accounting with real-time network interface statistics:

- **Overview Tab**: Shows active interfaces with current rates, errors, and drops
- **Activity Tab** (press `3`): Ranks processes by Egress (TX) or Ingress (RX), including retained and rolling traffic, rates, shares, connections, and destinations
- **Security Workflow**: Sort by Egress, identify an unexpected uploader, then inspect its top remote peer and retained traffic even after the connection closes
- **Host Tab** (press `5`): Shows TCP LISTEN sockets, UDP BOUND endpoints, aggregated TCP states, observed RTT, and process ownership
- **Interface Details** (press `i` on Host): Shows comprehensive metrics for every interface
- **Cross-Platform**: Linux (sysfs), macOS/FreeBSD (getifaddrs), Windows (GetIfTable2 API)
- **Smart Filtering**: Windows automatically excludes virtual/filter adapters

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md#interface-statistics) for detailed documentation on interpreting interface statistics and platform-specific behavior.

**Metrics Available:**
- Total bytes and packets (RX/TX)
- Error counters (receive and transmit)
- Packet drops (queue overflows)
- Collisions (legacy, rarely used on modern networks)

Stats are collected every 2 seconds in a background thread with minimal performance impact.

### Running RustNet

Packet capture requires elevated privileges:

```bash
# Quick start (all platforms)
sudo rustnet

# Linux: Grant capabilities to run without sudo (recommended)
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_bpf,cap_perfmon+eip' $(which rustnet)
rustnet
```

**Common options:**
```bash
rustnet -i eth0              # Specify network interface
rustnet --show-localhost     # Show localhost connections
rustnet --no-resolve-dns     # Disable reverse DNS lookups (enabled by default)
rustnet -r 500               # Set refresh interval (ms)
rustnet --theme tokyo-night  # Theme: muted (default), vivid, catppuccin-mocha, tokyo-night, gruvbox, nord
rustnet --pcapng-export capture.pcapng  # Annotated PCAPNG for Wireshark
```

The theme and per-color overrides can also be set in `~/.config/rustnet/config.toml`; `--theme` takes precedence. See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md#--theme-preset) for the schema.

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed permission setup and [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for complete options.

> If you set capabilities but the TUI still shows `eBPF unavailable`, see
> [eBPF Unavailable Despite Capabilities Being Set](INSTALL.md#ebpf-unavailable-despite-capabilities-being-set)
> in the troubleshooting section.

## Filtering & Sorting

**Quick filtering examples:**
```
/google                        # Search for "google" anywhere
/port:443                      # Filter by port
/process:firefox               # Filter by process
/state:established             # Filter by connection state
/dport:443 sni:github.com      # Combine filters
```

**Sorting:**
- Press `s` to cycle through sortable columns (Process, Addresses, Service, Application, State, Bandwidth)
- Press `S` (Shift+s) to toggle sort direction
- Find bandwidth hogs: Press `s` until "Bandwidth Total ↓" appears (sorts by combined up+down speed)

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for complete filtering syntax and sorting guide.

<details>
<summary><b>Advanced Filtering Examples</b></summary>

**Keyword filters:**
- `port:44` - Ports containing "44" (443, 8080, 4433)
- `sport:80` - Source ports containing "80"
- `dport:443` - Destination ports containing "443"
- `src:192.168` - Source IPs containing "192.168"
- `dst:github.com` - Destinations containing "github.com"
- `process:ssh` - Process names containing "ssh"
- `sni:api` - SNI hostnames containing "api"
- `app:openssh` - SSH connections using OpenSSH
- `state:established` - Filter by protocol state
- `proto:tcp` - Filter by protocol type

**State filtering:**
- `state:syn_recv` - Half-open connections (SYN flood detection)
- `state:established` - Established connections only
- `state:quic_connected` - Active QUIC connections
- `state:dns_query` - DNS query connections

**Combined examples:**
- `sport:80 process:nginx` - Nginx connections from port 80
- `dport:443 sni:google.com` - HTTPS to Google
- `process:firefox state:quic_connected` - Firefox QUIC connections
- `dport:22 app:openssh state:established` - Established OpenSSH connections

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Connection Lifecycle & Visual Indicators</b></summary>

RustNet uses smart timeouts and visual warnings before removing connections:

**Visual staleness indicators:**
- **Full color**: Active (< 50% of timeout)
- **Countdown**: Idle (50-100% of timeout); a `▎` stripe at the left edge and the time left in the bandwidth column run yellow through orange to red as removal nears, while the identifying columns soften toward gray
- **Gray**: Historic, closed and archived, shown as a faint row with `closed` in the State column (toggle `t` to show)

**Protocol-aware timeouts:**
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: 10 minutes (supports keep-alive)
- **SSH**: 30 minutes (long sessions)
- **Generic TCP established**: 5 minutes
- **QUIC connected**: 3 minutes (or peer's transport-param idle timeout, when present); `Initial`/`Handshaking`: 60 seconds
- **DNS**: 30 seconds
- **TCP CLOSED**: 15-second archival grace

Example: An HTTP connection shows its countdown from 5 min, is removed at 10 min, and then appears as a gray historic row when history is on.

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for complete timeout details.
