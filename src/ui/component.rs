//! Per-tab Component pattern adapted for rustnet's synchronous,
//! crossbeam-threaded UI loop.
//!
//! Differences from ratatui's official component template:
//! - No `tokio::sync::mpsc::UnboundedSender<Action>`: the loop is
//!   synchronous; components return `Vec<Effect>` from event
//!   handlers instead of pushing through a channel.
//! - No `register_action_handler` / `register_config_handler` /
//!   `init`: shared state (`App`, `UiState`) is passed through
//!   context structs on each call.
