# rustnet-host

Host-OS integration layer for [RustNet](https://github.com/domcyrus/rustnet):
the metadata about a connection that only the operating system / kernel can
tell us, behind one trait per concern.

The crate provides per-connection process attribution and a point-in-time host
socket inventory. Given a `rustnet_core` `Connection`, it finds the owning
process (pid + name) using the best strategy each platform offers, with
graceful fallbacks:

- **Linux**: fentry/fexit eBPF, legacy kprobes, then procfs.
- **macOS**: PKTAP packet metadata plus libproc when available, else `lsof`
  plus libproc.
- **Windows**: kernel ETW events with an IP Helper API
  (`GetExtendedTcpTable` / `...UdpTable`) fallback.
- **FreeBSD**: `sockstat`, enriched through native `sysctl` process metadata.

```rust
use rustnet_host::create_process_lookup;

let lookup = create_process_lookup(/* use_pktap = */ false)?;
if let Some(attribution) = lookup.get_process_attribution(&conn) {
    println!(
        "{} ({}) ppid={:?} uid={:?} exe={:?} lineage={:?} ({} match)",
        attribution.name,
        attribution.tgid,
        attribution.ppid,
        attribution.uid,
        attribution.executable,
        attribution.lineage,
        attribution.quality,
    );
}

for socket in lookup.socket_snapshot().sockets.iter() {
    println!("{} {} {:?}", socket.protocol, socket.local_addr, socket.state);
}
```

The socket inventory is independent of captured traffic. It exposes native TCP
states, including LISTEN, and marks UDP rows as BOUND because UDP has no LISTEN
state. Linux reads procfs socket tables, macOS uses numeric `lsof`, FreeBSD uses
`sockstat -s`, and Windows uses the IP Helper owner tables. Process ownership is
best effort, so a socket remains in the inventory when its owner cannot be
resolved.

`MatchQuality` records how the connection was matched, so a relaxed
wildcard/listener guess is never mistaken for a proven 4-tuple hit; use
`quality.is_exact()` to tell them apart. Linux resolves PPID from procfs for
both socket-table and eBPF matches. The eBPF backends also fill in the
effective UID/GID. The executable path is resolved once from
`/proc/<tgid>/exe`; an unreadable link yields `executable: None` and never
fails the attribution.

Every platform also resolves up to four parent processes, ordered from the
oldest retained ancestor to the direct parent. Each entry includes its PID,
name, executable path, and Unix start time when the OS exposes them. A
truncation flag marks chains capped before another known parent.

On macOS, PKTAP supplies an exact PID and process name with each packet. Libproc
adds the PPID, executable path, and effective UID/GID. The fallback parses
numeric UIDs from `lsof -l` and uses libproc for the other process details.
PKTAP reports `MatchQuality::ExactTuple`; lsof reports whether its socket-table
match was exact, wildcard-bound, or a listener.

On FreeBSD, `sockstat` supplies the socket owner and native `sysctl` queries add
the PPID, effective UID/GID, and executable path. Process details are cached by
PID for each socket-table refresh.

On Windows, Tool Help supplies parent relationships and process names, while
`QueryFullProcessImageNameW` and `GetProcessTimes` add executable paths and
creation times. Connection match quality remains `MatchQuality::Unspecified`.

When a platform can't use its optimal method, `ProcessLookup::get_degradation_reason`
reports why (e.g. missing `CAP_BPF`, no root for PKTAP) via `DegradationReason`,
which front-ends can surface to the user.

All Linux BPF objects use CO-RE for safe kernel field access and therefore
require usable target BTF. A compatible target-BTF kernel tries fentry/fexit
first and legacy kprobes second. On Linux 5.11 and newer, a separate one-shot
task-file iterator captures socket owners that predate the live probes. Its
failure leaves the selected live tracker running and falls back to the procfs
startup inventory. A kernel without usable target BTF falls directly to procfs
rather than relying on fixed structure offsets.

## Linux eBPF integration matrix

The ignored root test covers outbound TCP, accepted TCP, connected UDP, and
unconnected UDP for IPv4 and IPv6. It also verifies TGID/TID, UID/GID, `comm`,
monotonic timestamps, match quality, `/proc/<tgid>/exe` resolution, and that a
socket opened by a worker thread is attributed to that thread rather than to the
group leader.

```bash
sudo -E cargo test -p rustnet-host --features ebpf -- \
  --ignored --exact \
  linux::ebpf::tracker_libbpf::integration_tests::socket_attribution_matrix \
  --nocapture

sudo -E cargo test -p rustnet-host --features ebpf -- \
  --ignored --exact \
  linux::ebpf::tracker_libbpf::integration_tests::legacy_kprobe_socket_attribution_matrix \
  --nocapture

sudo -E cargo test -p rustnet-host --features ebpf -- \
  --ignored --exact \
  linux::ebpf::task_file::tests::kernel_iterator_reports_current_process_socket \
  --nocapture
```

## Scope

The crate is named `rustnet-host` rather than `rustnet-process` on purpose: it's
the home for *all* host/kernel-derived connection metadata. Process ownership
and socket state inventory are the first inhabitants; kernel TCP/UDP counters
and cgroup/container info are natural future additions that share the same eBPF
and OS-query machinery.

It depends only on `rustnet-core` (for `Connection`/`Protocol`); it does not
depend on `rustnet-capture`. On macOS the application injects whether PKTAP is
active rather than this crate querying capture. No UI or capture-loop
dependency, so headless tools can attribute processes the same way the `rustnet`
TUI does.
