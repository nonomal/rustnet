//! DNS-based hostname attribution cache.
//!
//! Builds an IP -> domain map from DNS responses observed on the wire and
//! lets callers tag connections with the most recently resolved hostname
//! for that IP. This is how a QUIC or plain-TCP connection gets a
//! human-readable hostname even when no SNI / Host header is visible:
//! when the user resolved `foo.com -> 1.2.3.4` a moment before opening
//! the connection, we can attribute that connection to `foo.com`.
//!
//! Conceptually equivalent to what Little Snitch's eBPF DNS cache does on
//! Linux, but driven from pcap. CNAME chains are handled implicitly
//! because the DNS DPI parser already records the original *question*
//! name; the IPs in the answer section map directly to that.
//!
//! The cache is owned by `ConnectionTracker` and is called from inside
//! the tracker's connection-map entry closures (a shard lock is held).
//! It must therefore only ever touch its own maps: no method here may
//! call back into the tracker's connection table.
