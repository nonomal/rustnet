//! Live connection tracking.
//!
//! [`ConnectionTracker`] folds parsed packets into a long-lived, lifecycle-
//! managed table of [`Connection`]s. It owns everything needed to turn a stream
//! of [`ParsedPacket`]s into the same connection view the `rustnet` TUI shows:
//! the active table, an archive of recently-closed ("historic") connections,
//! RTT estimation from TCP, QUIC handshakes, and ICMP echo, plus DNS-shaped
//! response timing, QUIC connection-ID coalescing, and timeout-based cleanup,
//! all without any UI, capture, or process-lookup
//! dependency.
//!
//! This is the piece that makes headless tools easy: pair a capture source with
//! a parser, then feed each parsed packet to [`ConnectionTracker::ingest_at`]
//! and periodically call [`ConnectionTracker::cleanup`]. A Prometheus exporter,
//! a pcap post-processor, or a test harness can all reuse the exact connection
//! semantics of the main application. Offline consumers replaying a saved trace
//! should pass each packet's capture timestamp so connection lifetimes and
//! timeouts follow trace time rather than the replay wall clock.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use rustnet_core::network::parser::PacketParser;
//! use rustnet_core::network::tracker::ConnectionTracker;
//! use std::time::SystemTime;
//!
//! let parser = PacketParser::new();
//! let tracker = ConnectionTracker::new();
//! # let frames: Vec<Vec<u8>> = Vec::new();
//! for frame in frames {
//!     if let Some(parsed) = parser.parse_packet(&frame) {
//!         tracker.ingest_at(&parsed, SystemTime::now());
//!     }
//! }
//! tracker.cleanup(SystemTime::now()); // expire idle/closed connections
//! for conn in tracker.snapshot() {
//!     println!("{} {} -> {}", conn.protocol, conn.local_addr, conn.remote_addr);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! All methods take `&self` (the internal tables use interior mutability), so a
//! single tracker can be wrapped in an [`std::sync::Arc`] and shared across a
//! capture thread, a cleanup thread, and a reader thread.
