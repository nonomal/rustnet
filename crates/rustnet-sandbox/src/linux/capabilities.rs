//! Linux capability management
//!
//! Handles dropping capabilities after they are no longer needed.
//! This follows the principle of least privilege - capabilities are
//! only held while necessary for initialization.
//!
//! # CAP_NET_RAW
//!
//! CAP_NET_RAW is required to create raw sockets for packet capture.
//! However, once the pcap handle is opened, the capability is no longer
//! needed and can be safely dropped. This prevents an attacker from
//! creating new raw sockets if they gain code execution.
//!
//! This is the same pattern used by `ping` and other network utilities.
