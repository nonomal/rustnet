//! Post-initialization sandboxing and privilege dropping for rustnet.
//!
//! One [`apply_sandbox`] entry point with a platform backend behind it:
//!
//! - **Linux**: `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`, capability drops (CAP_NET_RAW,
//!   CAP_BPF, CAP_PERFMON), the root uid drop, and Landlock
//!   filesystem/network/scope restrictions (behind the `landlock` feature).
//! - **macOS**: the root uid drop, then a Seatbelt profile blocking outbound
//!   network, credential reads, and writes outside configured output paths
//!   (behind the `macos-sandbox` feature).
//! - **Windows**: dangerous token privileges removed and a job object that
//!   blocks child process creation.
//! - **FreeBSD**: the root uid drop (Capsicum is planned).
//!
//! # Application order contract
//!
//! Sandboxing is a *post-initialization* step. Callers must apply it only
//! after every privileged operation is done, in this order:
//!
//! 1. Open capture handles (raw sockets, BPF/PKTAP devices, Npcap): the
//!    descriptors stay valid across the sandbox and uid drop.
//! 2. Load eBPF programs (needs CAP_BPF/CAP_PERFMON, which the sandbox
//!    drops).
//! 3. Pre-create output files (logs, PCAP exports) and, when dropping root,
//!    chown them to the drop target ([`privdrop::chown_to_target`]); Landlock
//!    needs an existing file to scope a write rule to it, and a path under a
//!    root-only directory cannot be reopened after the drop.
//! 4. Call [`apply_sandbox`] on the **main thread**.
//! 5. Only then spawn worker threads that should inherit the restrictions:
//!    Landlock domains and capability sets are per-thread state that new
//!    threads inherit from their spawner; threads started before step 4 keep
//!    the unrestricted state.
//!
//! Threads that must run before the sandbox (capture, enrichment) should shed
//! the capabilities they do not need themselves via [`capabilities`]
//! (Linux, `landlock` feature). A thread that keeps calling `bpf(2)` must
//! retain CAP_BPF ([`capabilities::drop_thread_cap_net_raw`]); all others can
//! use [`capabilities::drop_unused_thread_caps`].
