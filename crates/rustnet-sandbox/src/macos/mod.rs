//! macOS sandboxing support
//!
//! Drops the root uid (when applicable) and then applies a Seatbelt profile
//! restricting the process after initialization is complete. This is a
//! defense-in-depth measure that limits damage if the application (processing
//! untrusted network data) is compromised.
//!
//! # Security Model
//!
//! After sandboxing is applied:
//! - Identity: when started as root (e.g. `sudo rustnet`), euid/egid drop to
//!   the invoking user (SUDO_UID/SUDO_GID) or `nobody`, see
//!   [`privdrop`](crate::privdrop). Disable with `--no-uid-drop`.
//! - Network: Outbound TCP/UDP connections blocked (RustNet is passive)
//! - Filesystem writes: Credential directories blocked (~/.ssh, ~/.aws, etc.)
//! - Filesystem writes: Only configured log and PCAP export paths writable
//!
//! The uid drop runs BEFORE Seatbelt so the profile does not need to allow
//! the setuid/setgid syscalls. Without the `macos-sandbox` feature only the
//! uid drop is performed.
//!
//! # Compatibility
//!
//! - macOS 10.5+: Full support (Seatbelt has been present since Leopard)
//! - All Intel and Apple Silicon hardware supported
