# RustNet runs as the non-root 'rustnet' user. CAP_NET_RAW is baked into the
# binary as a file capability and is part of Docker's default bounding set, so
# basic packet capture works out of the box:
#   docker run rustnet
# eBPF-based process attribution needs BPF+PERFMON, which are NOT in the default
# bounding set and can't be granted to a non-root user via file capabilities.
# Enable eBPF by running as root with the extra caps (modern kernels 5.8+):
#   docker run --user root --cap-add=BPF --cap-add=PERFMON rustnet
# Legacy kernels require broad CAP_SYS_ADMIN for eBPF. RustNet does not
# recommend granting it by default; without eBPF caps, rustnet falls back to
# /proc-based process detection.
# CAP_NET_ADMIN is NOT required (read-only, non-promiscuous capture).
