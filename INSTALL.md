## Installing from Release Packages

Pre-built packages are available for each release on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/domcyrus/rustnet/releases) page.

### macOS DMG Installation

> ** Prefer Homebrew?** If you have Homebrew installed, using `brew install` is easier and avoids Gatekeeper bypass steps. See [Homebrew Installation](#homebrew-installation) for instructions.

1. **Download** the appropriate DMG for your architecture:
   - `Rustnet_macOS_AppleSilicon.dmg` for Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3)
   - `Rustnet_macOS_Intel.dmg` for Intel-based Macs

2. **Open the DMG** and drag Rustnet.app to your Applications folder

3. **Bypass Gatekeeper** (for unsigned builds):
   - When you first try to open RustNet, macOS will block it because the app is not signed
   - Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
   - Scroll down to find the message about RustNet being blocked
   - Click **"Open Anyway"** to allow the application to run
   - You may need to confirm this choice when launching the app again

4. **Run RustNet**:
   - Double-click Rustnet.app to launch it in a Terminal window with sudo
   - Or run from command line: `sudo /Applications/Rustnet.app/Contents/MacOS/rustnet`

5. **Optional: Create a symlink for shell access**:
   ```bash
   # Create a symlink so you can run 'rustnet' from anywhere
   sudo ln -s /Applications/Rustnet.app/Contents/MacOS/rustnet /usr/local/bin/rustnet

   # Now you can run from any terminal:
   sudo rustnet
   ```

6. **Optional: Setup BPF permissions** (to avoid needing sudo):
   - Install Wireshark's BPF permission helper: `brew install --cask wireshark-chmodbpf`
   - Log out and back in for group changes to take effect
   - See the [Permissions Setup](#permissions-setup) section for detailed instructions

### Windows MSI Installation

1. **Install Npcap Runtime** (required for packet capture):
   - Download from https://npcap.com/dist/
   - Run the installer. The default settings are supported; WinPcap API-compatible mode is not required

2. **Download and install** the appropriate MSI package:
   - `Rustnet_Windows_64-bit.msi` for 64-bit Windows
   - `Rustnet_Windows_32-bit.msi` for 32-bit Windows

3. **Run the installer** and follow the installation wizard

4. **Run RustNet**:
   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
   - Run: `rustnet.exe`
   - If Npcap is not installed or cannot be loaded, RustNet will display a helpful error message with installation instructions
   - Note: Depending on your Npcap installation settings, you may or may not need Administrator privileges

### Windows Chocolatey Installation

The easiest way to install RustNet on Windows is via [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rustnet):

```powershell
# Run in Administrator PowerShell
choco install rustnet
```

**Note:** You still need to install [Npcap](https://npcap.com) separately. The default installer settings are supported.

### Linux Package Installation

#### Ubuntu PPA (Recommended for Ubuntu 22.04+, Linux Mint and Pop!_OS)

The easiest way to install RustNet on Ubuntu and its derivatives is via the official PPA. The PPA publishes builds for the following Ubuntu series:

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)
- Ubuntu 26.04 LTS (Resolute Raccoon)

Derivatives register PPAs under their Ubuntu base series, so the same commands work there:

- Linux Mint 21.x (Jammy base) and 22.x (Noble base)
- Pop!_OS 22.04 (Jammy base) and 24.04 (Noble base). Pop!_OS ships `apt-manage` instead of `add-apt-repository`: use `sudo apt-manage add ppa:domcyrus/rustnet`.

```bash
# Add the RustNet PPA
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:domcyrus/rustnet

# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install rustnet
sudo apt install rustnet

# Run with sudo
sudo rustnet

# Optional: Grant capabilities to run without sudo (modern kernel 5.8+)
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_bpf,cap_perfmon+eip' /usr/bin/rustnet
rustnet
```

**Important:** The PPA supports only the four series listed above because the build requires Rust 1.88+ (used for let-chains in the project). Other Ubuntu series don't ship a recent enough `rustc` in their repositories. For those, use the [.deb packages](#debianubuntu-deb-packages) from GitHub releases or [build from source](#building-from-source).

#### Debian/Ubuntu (.deb packages)

For manual installation or non-Ubuntu Debian-based distributions:

```bash
# Download the appropriate package for your architecture:
# - Rustnet_LinuxDEB_amd64.deb (x86_64)
# - Rustnet_LinuxDEB_arm64.deb (ARM64)
# - Rustnet_LinuxDEB_armhf.deb (ARMv7)

# Install the package (capabilities are automatically configured)
sudo dpkg -i Rustnet_LinuxDEB_amd64.deb

# Install dependencies if needed
sudo apt-get install -f

# Run without sudo (capabilities were set by post-install script)
rustnet

# Verify capabilities
getcap /usr/bin/rustnet
```

**Note:** The .deb package automatically sets Linux capabilities via post-install script, so you can run RustNet without sudo.

#### RedHat/Fedora/CentOS (.rpm packages)

For manual installation or distributions not using COPR:

```bash
# Download the appropriate package for your architecture:
# - Rustnet_LinuxRPM_x86_64.rpm
# - Rustnet_LinuxRPM_aarch64.rpm

# Install the package (capabilities are automatically configured)
sudo rpm -i Rustnet_LinuxRPM_x86_64.rpm
# Or with dnf/yum:
sudo dnf install Rustnet_LinuxRPM_x86_64.rpm

# Run without sudo (capabilities were set by post-install script)
rustnet

# Verify capabilities
getcap /usr/bin/rustnet
```

**Note:** The .rpm package automatically sets Linux capabilities via post-install script, so you can run RustNet without sudo.

#### Arch Linux

This package is included in the Arch Linux Extra repository ([link](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/rustnet/)). It can be installed using pacman:
```bash
sudo pacman -S rustnet
```

Alternatively, two AUR packages are available:
- [`rustnet-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rustnet-bin) - Pre-compiled binary from GitHub Releases
- [`rustnet-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rustnet-git) - Build from source and use the latest commit (maintained by [@DeepChirp](https://github.com/DeepChirp))

Install with your preferred AUR helper:
```bash
# Pre-compiled binary from GitHub Releases
yay -S rustnet-bin

# OR source build from the latest commit
yay -S rustnet-git
```

#### Nix / NixOS

RustNet is available in [nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages?query=rustnet), including the **stable** channels (as well as `nixpkgs-unstable`).

**Try it without installing (ephemeral shell):**

```bash
nix-shell -p rustnet
# Then inside the shell:
sudo rustnet
```

**Persistent install on NixOS** — add to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  rustnet
];
```

Then run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`.

**Note on permissions:** NixOS's `/nix/store` is read-only, so `sudo setcap` on the binary won't persist across rebuilds. The simplest option is `sudo rustnet`. For sudo-less operation, define a NixOS [security.wrappers](https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&query=security.wrappers) entry that carries the capabilities:

```nix
security.wrappers.rustnet = {
  source = "${pkgs.rustnet}/bin/rustnet";
  owner = "root";
  group = "root";
  capabilities = "cap_net_raw,cap_bpf,cap_perfmon+eip";
};
```

Then run `rustnet` via the wrapper path (`/run/wrappers/bin/rustnet`).

> **Coming soon — dedicated NixOS module.** A [`programs.rustnet`
> module](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/517620) is in review for
> nixpkgs. Once merged it wraps exactly the capabilities above for you, so the
> whole setup becomes:
>
> ```nix
> programs.rustnet.enable = true;
> ```
>
> This grants `cap_net_raw`, `cap_bpf`, and `cap_perfmon` (but **not**
> `cap_net_admin`, since RustNet never needs promiscuous mode) through
> `security.wrappers` — the same pattern `programs.mtr` and
> `programs.wireshark` use — letting you run `rustnet` without sudo.

#### Fedora (COPR - Recommended for Fedora 42+)

The easiest way to install RustNet on Fedora is via the official COPR repository.

```bash
# Enable the COPR repository
sudo dnf copr enable domcyrus/rustnet

# Install rustnet
sudo dnf install rustnet

# Run with sudo
sudo rustnet

# Optional: Grant capabilities to run without sudo (modern kernel 5.8+)
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_bpf,cap_perfmon+eip' /usr/bin/rustnet
rustnet
```

**Important:** The COPR only supports Fedora 42 and 43 due to the Rust 1.88+ requirement. CentOS and RHEL don't have recent enough Rust compilers in their repositories. For those distributions, use the [.rpm packages](#redhatfedoracentos-rpm-packages) from GitHub releases or [build from source](#building-from-source).

#### openSUSE Tumbleweed (OBS)

RustNet is built for openSUSE Tumbleweed (x86_64 and aarch64) via the [openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:domcyrus:rustnet/rustnet).

```bash
sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/domcyrus:/rustnet/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/home:domcyrus:rustnet.repo
sudo zypper refresh
sudo zypper install rustnet

# Run with sudo
sudo rustnet

# Optional: Grant capabilities to run without sudo (modern kernel 5.8+)
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_bpf,cap_perfmon+eip' /usr/bin/rustnet
rustnet
```

#### Homebrew Installation

**On macOS:**
```bash
brew install rustnet

# Follow the caveats displayed after installation for permission setup
```

**On Linux:**
```bash
brew install rustnet

# Grant capabilities to the Homebrew-installed binary (modern kernel 5.8+)
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_bpf,cap_perfmon+eip' $(brew --prefix)/bin/rustnet

# Run without sudo
rustnet
```

#### Static Binary (Portable - Any Linux Distribution)

For maximum portability, static binaries are available that work on **any Linux distribution** regardless of GLIBC version. These are fully self-contained and require no system dependencies.

```bash
# Download the static binary for your architecture:
# - rustnet-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz (x86_64)
# - rustnet-vX.Y.Z-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz (ARM64)

# Extract the archive
tar xzf rustnet-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz

# Move binary to PATH
sudo mv rustnet-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/rustnet /usr/local/bin/

# Grant capabilities (modern kernel 5.8+)
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_bpf,cap_perfmon+eip' /usr/local/bin/rustnet

# Run without sudo
rustnet
```

**When to use static binaries:**
- Older distributions with outdated GLIBC (e.g., CentOS 7, older Ubuntu)
- Minimal/containerized environments
- Air-gapped systems where installing dependencies is difficult
- When you want a single portable binary

### FreeBSD Installation

FreeBSD support is available starting from version 0.15.0.

#### From Ports or Packages (Future)

Once available in FreeBSD ports:
```bash
# Using pkg (binary packages)
pkg install rustnet

# Or build from ports
cd /usr/ports/net/rustnet && make install clean
```

#### From GitHub Releases

Download the FreeBSD binary from the [rustnet-bsd releases](https://github.com/domcyrus/rustnet-bsd/releases):

```bash
# Download the appropriate package
fetch https://github.com/domcyrus/rustnet-bsd/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/rustnet-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-unknown-freebsd.tar.gz

# Extract the archive
tar xzf rustnet-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-unknown-freebsd.tar.gz

# Move binary to PATH
sudo mv rustnet-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-unknown-freebsd/rustnet /usr/local/bin/

# Make it executable
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rustnet

# Run with sudo
sudo rustnet
```

#### Building from Source on FreeBSD

```bash
# Install dependencies
pkg install rust libpcap

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/domcyrus/rustnet.git
cd rustnet

# Build in release mode
cargo build --release

# The executable will be in target/release/rustnet
sudo ./target/release/rustnet
```

#### Permission Setup for FreeBSD

FreeBSD requires access to BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) devices for packet capture.

**Option 1: Run with sudo (Simplest)**
```bash
sudo rustnet
```

**Option 2: Add user to the bpf group (Recommended)**
```bash
# Add your user to the bpf group
sudo pw groupmod bpf -m $(whoami)

# Log out and back in for group changes to take effect

# Now run without sudo
rustnet
```

**Option 3: Change BPF device permissions (Temporary)**
```bash
# This will reset on reboot
sudo chmod o+rw /dev/bpf*

# Now run without sudo
rustnet
```

**Verifying FreeBSD Permissions:**
```bash
# Check if you're in the bpf group
groups | grep bpf

# Check BPF device permissions
ls -la /dev/bpf*

# Test without sudo
rustnet --help
```

### Android (Termux) Installation

RustNet can run on Android devices via [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/), provided the device is rooted.

Because Android strictly controls network and process information, RustNet requires `root` access (`su`) to capture packets and identify processes. A specialized Android build is provided that statically links dependencies and disables Linux-specific features (like eBPF and Landlock) that are incompatible with Android's kernel environment.

#### Prerequisites
1. **Rooted** Android device (e.g., via Magisk or KernelSU)
2. **Termux** installed (from F-Droid or GitHub, *not* Google Play)

#### Installation Steps

1. **Install required packages in Termux:**
   ```bash
   pkg update
   pkg install tsu wget tar
   ```

2. **Download the Android binary:**
   ```bash
   # Download the Android-specific static binary from GitHub Releases
   wget https://github.com/domcyrus/rustnet/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/rustnet-vX.Y.Z-aarch64-linux-android-musl.tar.gz
   ```

3. **Extract and install:**
   ```bash
   tar xzf rustnet-vX.Y.Z-aarch64-linux-android-musl.tar.gz
   
   # Move it to a directory in your PATH
   mv rustnet-vX.Y.Z-aarch64-linux-android-musl/rustnet $PREFIX/bin/
   chmod +x $PREFIX/bin/rustnet
   ```

4. **Run RustNet as root:**
   ```bash
   # You must run RustNet with root privileges for it to function on Android
   sudo rustnet
   ```
   *Note: On first run, your root manager (e.g., Magisk) will prompt you to grant Superuser access to Termux.*

## Install via Cargo

```bash
# Install directly from crates.io
cargo install rustnet-monitor

# The binary will be installed to ~/.cargo/bin/rustnet
# Make sure ~/.cargo/bin is in your PATH
```

After installation, see the [Permissions Setup](#permissions-setup) section to configure permissions.

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Rust 2024 edition or later (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- Platform-specific dependencies:
  - **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libpcap-dev libelf-dev zlib1g-dev clang llvm
    ```
  - **Linux (RedHat/CentOS/Fedora)**:
    ```bash
    sudo yum install make pkgconfig libpcap-devel elfutils-libelf-devel zlib-devel clang llvm
    ```
  - **macOS**: Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
  - **FreeBSD**: `pkg install rust libpcap`
  - **Windows**: Install Npcap and Npcap SDK (see [Windows Build Setup](#windows-build-setup) below)

### Basic Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/domcyrus/rustnet.git
cd rustnet

# Build in release mode (eBPF is enabled by default on Linux)
cargo build --release

# To build WITHOUT eBPF support (procfs-only mode on Linux)
cargo build --release --no-default-features

# The executable will be in target/release/rustnet
```

To build without eBPF (procfs-only mode), use `cargo build --release --no-default-features`.

### Windows Build Setup

Building RustNet on Windows requires the Npcap SDK and proper environment configuration:

#### Build Requirements

1. **Download and Install Npcap SDK**:
   - Download the Npcap SDK from https://npcap.com/dist/
   - Extract the SDK to a directory (e.g., `C:\npcap-sdk`)

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Set the `LIB` environment variable to include the SDK's library path:
     ```cmd
     set LIB=%LIB%;C:\npcap-sdk\Lib\x64
     ```
   - For PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     $env:LIB = "$env:LIB;C:\npcap-sdk\Lib\x64"
     ```
   - For permanent setup, add this to your system environment variables

3. **Build RustNet**:
   ```cmd
   cargo build --release
   ```

#### Runtime Requirements

1. **Install Npcap Runtime**:
   - Download the Npcap installer from https://npcap.com/dist/
   - Run the installer. The default settings are supported; WinPcap API-compatible mode is not required

2. **Run RustNet**:
   ```cmd
   rustnet.exe
   ```

**Note**: Depending on your Npcap installation settings, you may or may not need Administrator privileges. If you didn't select the option to restrict packet capture to administrators during Npcap installation, RustNet can run with normal user privileges.

## Using Docker

RustNet is available as a Docker container from GitHub Container Registry. The
image runs as a **non-root** user by default, with `CAP_NET_RAW` baked into the
binary as a file capability — so basic packet capture works with no extra flags.

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/domcyrus/rustnet:latest

# Or pull a specific version
docker pull ghcr.io/domcyrus/rustnet:0.7.0

# Option A — basic monitoring (non-root, recommended)
# Captures packets via the built-in CAP_NET_RAW file capability. Process
# attribution uses /proc (eBPF disabled). No --cap-add needed.
docker run --rm -it --net=host ghcr.io/domcyrus/rustnet:latest

# Option B — full eBPF process attribution (runs as root + extra caps)
# eBPF needs CAP_BPF + CAP_PERFMON. A non-root user can't make these effective
# from --cap-add alone, so enable them by also running as root.
docker run --rm -it --user root \
  --cap-add=NET_RAW --cap-add=BPF --cap-add=PERFMON --net=host \
  ghcr.io/domcyrus/rustnet:latest

# Run with a specific interface (either option; -i flag at the end)
docker run --rm -it --net=host ghcr.io/domcyrus/rustnet:latest -i eth0

# Alternative: privileged mode (simplest, least secure)
docker run --rm -it --privileged --net=host \
  ghcr.io/domcyrus/rustnet:latest

# View available options
docker run --rm ghcr.io/domcyrus/rustnet:latest --help
```

**Note:** Basic capture (Option A) needs no special flags — the image carries
`CAP_NET_RAW` as a file capability and runs non-root. eBPF-based process
attribution (Option B) additionally needs `CAP_BPF` + `CAP_PERFMON`; because
those can't be granted to a non-root user via file capabilities, enable them by
running as root (`--user root`) with the matching `--cap-add` flags. Either way,
rustnet drops these capabilities and sandboxes itself immediately after startup.
Host networking (`--net=host`) is recommended for monitoring all interfaces.

## Permissions Setup

RustNet requires elevated privileges to capture network packets because accessing network interfaces for packet capture is a privileged operation on all modern operating systems. This section explains how to properly grant these permissions on different platforms.

> ### **Security Advantage: Read-Only Network Access on Linux**
>
> **RustNet uses read-only packet capture without promiscuous mode on all platforms.** This means:
>
> **Linux:** Requires only **`CAP_NET_RAW`** capability - **NOT** full root or `CAP_NET_ADMIN`
> **Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimal permissions needed for packet capture
> **No Promiscuous Mode:** Only captures packets to/from the host (not all network traffic)
> **Read-Only:** Cannot modify or inject packets
> **Enhanced Security:** Reduced attack surface compared to full root access
>
> **macOS Note:** PKTAP (for process metadata) requires root privileges, but you can run without sudo using the `lsof` fallback for basic packet capture.

### Why Permissions Are Required

Network packet capture requires access to:

- **Raw sockets** for low-level network access (read-only, non-promiscuous mode)
- **Network interfaces** for packet capture
- **BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) devices** on macOS/BSD systems
- **Network namespaces** on some Linux configurations

These capabilities are restricted to prevent malicious software from intercepting network traffic.

### macOS Permission Setup

On macOS, packet capture requires access to BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) devices located at `/dev/bpf*`.

**Note:** macOS PKTAP (for extracting process metadata from packets) requires **root/sudo** privileges. Without sudo, RustNet uses `lsof` as a fallback for process detection (slower but works without root).

#### Option 1: Run with sudo (Simplest)

```bash
# Build and run with sudo
cargo build --release
sudo ./target/release/rustnet
```

#### Option 2: BPF Group Access (Recommended)

Add your user to the `access_bpf` group for passwordless packet capture:

**Using Wireshark's ChmodBPF (For basic packet capture):**

```bash
# Install Wireshark's BPF permission helper
brew install --cask wireshark-chmodbpf

# Log out and back in for group changes to take effect
# Then run rustnet without sudo:
rustnet  # Uses lsof for process detection (slower)

# For PKTAP support with process metadata from packet headers, use sudo:
sudo rustnet  # Uses PKTAP for faster process detection
```

**Note**: `wireshark-chmodbpf` grants access to `/dev/bpf*` for packet capture, but **PKTAP** is a separate privileged kernel interface that requires root privileges regardless of BPF permissions. The TUI will display which detection method is active ("pktap" with sudo, or "lsof" without).

**Manual BPF Group Setup:**

```bash
# Create the access_bpf group (if it doesn't exist)
sudo dseditgroup -o create access_bpf

# Add your user to the group
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a $USER -t user access_bpf

# Set permissions on BPF devices (this needs to be done after each reboot)
sudo chmod g+rw /dev/bpf*
sudo chgrp access_bpf /dev/bpf*

# Log out and back in for group membership to take effect
```

#### Option 3: Homebrew Installation

If installed via Homebrew, the formula will provide detailed setup instructions:

```bash
brew install rustnet
# Follow the caveats displayed after installation
```

### Linux Permission Setup (Read-Only Access - No Root Required!)

**Linux Advantage:** RustNet requires **only `CAP_NET_RAW`** for packet capture - far less than full root access!

On Linux, packet capture requires only the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability for read-only, non-promiscuous packet capture. For eBPF-enhanced process tracking, additional capabilities (`CAP_BPF` and `CAP_PERFMON`) are needed, but **`CAP_NET_ADMIN` is NOT required**.

#### Option 1: Run with sudo (Simplest)

```bash
# Build and run with sudo
cargo build --release
sudo ./target/release/rustnet
```

#### Option 2: Grant Capabilities (Recommended)

Grant specific network capabilities to the binary without full root privileges:

**For source builds:**

```bash
# Build the binary first
cargo build --release

# Grant capabilities to the binary (modern kernel 5.8+, with eBPF support)
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_bpf,cap_perfmon+eip' ./target/release/rustnet

# Now run without sudo
./target/release/rustnet
```

**For cargo-installed binaries:**

```bash
# If installed via cargo install rustnet-monitor (modern kernel 5.8+)
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_bpf,cap_perfmon+eip' ~/.cargo/bin/rustnet

# Now run without sudo
rustnet
```

**For eBPF-enabled builds (enhanced Linux performance, enabled by default):**

eBPF is enabled by default on Linux. RustNet first attempts BPF trampoline
programs using fentry/fexit, then falls back to legacy kprobes, and finally to
procfs. Backend support is determined by actual program load and attachment
results, not the reported kernel version. Both BPF backends use CO-RE socket
field reads and require usable target BTF. When target BTF is unavailable,
RustNet falls directly to procfs rather than using fixed kernel-structure
offsets that could produce incorrect attribution.

```bash
# Build in release mode (eBPF is enabled by default)
cargo build --release

# Modern Linux (5.8+) - works with just these three capabilities:
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_bpf,cap_perfmon+eip' ./target/release/rustnet
./target/release/rustnet

# Packet capture only - eBPF falls back to procfs:
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw+eip' ./target/release/rustnet
./target/release/rustnet

# Check the TUI Statistics panel for the selected backend.
```

**Capability requirements:**

**Base capability (always required):**
- `CAP_NET_RAW` - Raw socket access for read-only packet capture (non-promiscuous mode)

**eBPF-specific capabilities (Linux 5.8+):**
- `CAP_BPF` - BPF program loading and map operations
- `CAP_PERFMON` - Performance monitoring and tracing operations

**Legacy Linux (pre-5.8):**
Older kernels require broad `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` for eBPF operations. RustNet does
not recommend or automatically grant it. Use `CAP_NET_RAW` only and let process
attribution fall back to procfs unless you explicitly accept the extra risk.

Kernels without memcg-based BPF memory accounting may also require a larger
`RLIMIT_MEMLOCK`. libbpf raises it automatically when permitted. For a systemd
service, set `LimitMEMLOCK=infinity` if BPF loading reports a memlock failure.

**Note:** CAP_NET_ADMIN is NOT required. RustNet uses read-only packet capture without promiscuous mode.

**Fallback behavior:** RustNet attempts the backends in this order:

1. `eBPF fentry/fexit + procfs`
2. `eBPF kprobe + procfs`
3. `procfs`

The TUI Statistics panel reports the selected backend. A missing optional ICMP
hook produces partial ICMP coverage without disabling TCP and UDP attribution.
Falling back from fentry/fexit to kprobes is not reported as a degradation —
both backends provide the same attribution coverage, and the fentry error is
written to the log. If both BPF backends fail, the panel shows the classified
reason for the legacy backend's failure and the log retains both full errors.

**Note:** eBPF is enabled by default on Linux builds and may have limitations with process name display. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for details on eBPF implementation. To build without eBPF, use `cargo build --release --no-default-features`.

**For system-wide installation:**

```bash
# If installed via package manager or copied to /usr/local/bin (modern kernel 5.8+)
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_bpf,cap_perfmon+eip' /usr/local/bin/rustnet
rustnet
```

### Windows Permission and Process Attribution Setup<a id="windows-permission-setup"></a>

Windows has two independent permission paths:

1. **Packet capture** uses Npcap. Whether RustNet must run as Administrator is
   determined by the options selected when Npcap was installed. If Npcap was
   configured to restrict capture to administrators, start Command Prompt,
   PowerShell, or Windows Terminal with **Run as administrator**. Otherwise a
   standard-user process can capture packets.
2. **Process attribution** prefers Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) and always
   keeps the IP Helper API available for reconciliation and fallback.

At startup RustNet attempts to subscribe to the Windows kernel network and
process ETW providers. The Overview tab reports the resulting mode:

| Detection display | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ETW + IP Helper` | Event-driven attribution is active. ETW catches short-lived processes; IP Helper fills cache misses and reconciles current sockets. |
| `IP Helper` | ETW could not be started. RustNet continues without failing, using `GetExtendedTcpTable` and `GetExtendedUdpTable`. Very short-lived processes may be missed between table snapshots. |

An Administrator shell is the most compatible way to enable ETW. A local
administrator can instead grant a user trace-session rights by adding that user
to the built-in **Performance Log Users** group (SID `S-1-5-32-559`). Sign out
and back in after changing group membership. Provider security policy can still
deny a particular ETW provider, so check the Overview tab rather than assuming
ETW is active.

ETW authorization and Npcap authorization are separate. Membership in
**Performance Log Users** does not grant packet-capture access, and a
non-administrator can still use IP Helper process attribution when ETW is
unavailable. No manual fallback option is necessary: RustNet selects the best
available mode automatically.

Some rows may remain `<unknown>` even with ETW. Examples include ARP and ICMP
traffic without a socket owner, system-owned traffic, packets seen before the
ETW session started, and events for which Windows does not expose a readable
process image.

### Verifying Permissions

To verify that permissions are set up correctly:

#### macOS

```bash
# Check BPF device permissions
ls -la /dev/bpf*

# Check group membership
groups | grep access_bpf

# Test without sudo
rustnet --help
```

#### Linux

```bash
# Check capabilities on the binary
# For source builds:
getcap ./target/release/rustnet

# For cargo-installed binaries:
getcap ~/.cargo/bin/rustnet

# For system-wide installations:
getcap $(which rustnet)

# eBPF enabled: Should show cap_net_raw,cap_bpf,cap_perfmon+eip
# Packet capture only: Should show cap_net_raw=eip

# Test without sudo
rustnet --help
```

## GeoIP Databases (Optional)

RustNet supports GeoIP lookups to show country codes, city names, and ASN information for remote IPs. To enable this, install the [GeoLite2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data) databases using MaxMind's `geoipupdate` tool (requires a free [MaxMind account](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup)).

**Available databases:**

| Database | Provides | Flag |
|---|---|---|
| `GeoLite2-Country.mmdb` | Country code and name | *(auto-discovered)* |
| `GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb` | ASN number and organization | *(auto-discovered)* |
| `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` | City name, postal code, **and** country | *(auto-discovered)* |

> **Tip:** `GeoLite2-City` is a superset of `GeoLite2-Country`. If you install the City database you do not need to also install the Country database.

### Configuring which databases to download

In your `GeoIP.conf`, set `EditionIDs` to include the databases you want:

```
# Country + ASN only:
EditionIDs GeoLite2-Country GeoLite2-ASN

# City + ASN (City includes country data):
EditionIDs GeoLite2-City GeoLite2-ASN

# All three:
EditionIDs GeoLite2-Country GeoLite2-ASN GeoLite2-City
```

### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install geoipupdate
# Edit the config with your MaxMind account credentials and EditionIDs:
#   $(brew --prefix)/etc/GeoIP.conf
geoipupdate
```

Databases are installed to `$(brew --prefix)/share/GeoIP/`.

### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get install geoipupdate
# Edit /etc/GeoIP.conf with your MaxMind account credentials and EditionIDs
sudo geoipupdate
```

Databases are installed to `/usr/share/GeoIP/`.

### Fedora/RHEL

```bash
sudo dnf install geoipupdate
# Edit /etc/GeoIP.conf with your MaxMind account credentials and EditionIDs
sudo geoipupdate
```

Databases are installed to `/usr/share/GeoIP/`.

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S geoipupdate
# Edit /etc/GeoIP.conf with your MaxMind account credentials and EditionIDs
sudo geoipupdate
```

Databases are installed to `/usr/share/GeoIP/`.

### FreeBSD

```bash
pkg install geoipupdate
# Edit /usr/local/etc/GeoIP.conf with your MaxMind account credentials and EditionIDs
sudo geoipupdate
```

Databases are installed to `/usr/local/share/GeoIP/`.

### Manual Specification

If your databases are in a non-standard location, specify them directly:

```bash
# Country + ASN:
rustnet --geoip-country /path/to/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb --geoip-asn /path/to/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb

# City + ASN (City includes country data):
rustnet --geoip-city /path/to/GeoLite2-City.mmdb --geoip-asn /path/to/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb
```

RustNet auto-discovers databases from standard locations. Run `rustnet --help` to see the full search path list.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

#### Permission Denied Errors

**On macOS:**

- Ensure you're in the `access_bpf` group: `groups | grep access_bpf`
- Check BPF device permissions: `ls -la /dev/bpf0`
- Try running with sudo to confirm it's a permission issue
- Log out and back in after group changes

**On Linux:**

- Check if capabilities are set: `getcap $(which rustnet)` or `getcap ~/.cargo/bin/rustnet`
- Verify libpcap is installed: `ldconfig -p | grep pcap`
- Try running with sudo to confirm it's a permission issue: `sudo $(which rustnet)`

#### No Suitable Capture Interfaces Found

- Check available interfaces: `ip link show` (Linux) or `ifconfig` (macOS)
- Try specifying an interface explicitly: `rustnet -i eth0`
- Ensure the interface is up and has an IP address
- Some virtual interfaces may not support packet capture

#### Operation Not Permitted (with capabilities set)

- Capabilities may have been removed by system updates
- Re-apply capabilities (modern): `sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_bpf,cap_perfmon+eip' $(which rustnet)`
- Some filesystems don't support extended attributes (capabilities)
- Try copying the binary to a different filesystem (e.g., from NFS to local disk)

#### eBPF Unavailable Despite Capabilities Being Set

If RustNet shows `Process Detection: procfs` with a degradation message even
after running `setcap`, work through the following checks. The TUI surfaces
the actual reason on the second status line — use it to jump to the right
section below.

**1. `file caps ignored: binary on a nosuid mount`**

The kernel silently ignores file capabilities for binaries that live on a
filesystem mounted with the `nosuid` option. Common culprits: `/home` on
hardened distros, `/tmp`, removable media, some bind-mounts inside
containers.

```bash
# Find the mount that holds the binary and check its options
findmnt -T $(realpath $(which rustnet)) -o TARGET,OPTIONS
# If the OPTIONS column contains "nosuid", caps will not work.

# Fix: install or copy the binary to a mount without nosuid
sudo install -m 0755 $(which rustnet) /usr/local/bin/rustnet
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_bpf,cap_perfmon+eip' /usr/local/bin/rustnet
/usr/local/bin/rustnet
```

**2. `BPF denied` or all eBPF backends failed**

Caps were granted, but the kernel returned `EPERM` or `EACCES`. Check these
layers in order:

```bash
# 2a. AppArmor or another LSM may confine rustnet.
sudo aa-status | grep rustnet
# If listed, allow capability bpf, capability perfmon, and the bpf() syscall.

# 2b. unprivileged_bpf_disabled (Debian sets =2; file caps should bypass).
sysctl kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled

# Confirm caps actually became effective at exec:
grep ^Cap /proc/$(pgrep -n rustnet)/status
# CapEff must include CAP_BPF (bit 39) and CAP_PERFMON (bit 38).

# 2c. perf_event_paranoid affects only the legacy kprobe fallback.
#     Debian 13 ships with kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3, which blocks
#     perf_event_open(2) for non-root users even with CAP_PERFMON.
#     The preferred fentry/fexit backend uses BPF_LINK_CREATE and does not call
#     perf_event_open(2), so a compatible fentry kernel needs no sysctl change.
#
#     Ubuntu uses a different patch (paranoid=4) that was updated in
#     late 2025 to honor CAP_PERFMON, so on recent Ubuntu kernels
#     (Jammy 5.15.0-165+, Noble 6.8.0-91+, Plucky 6.14.0-37+,
#     Questing 6.17.0-14+, Resolute 6.18.0-8+) `setcap` alone is
#     enough — no sysctl change required. Debian's equivalent patch
#     (bug #994044) was never updated and was archived in 2025
#     without a fix, so Debian users still need the workaround below.
sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid
# If the value is 3 (Debian) or 4 on an old Ubuntu kernel, drop it to 2:
sudo sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=2
# Make it persist across reboot:
echo 'kernel.perf_event_paranoid = 2' | \
  sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-rustnet.conf
```

**3. `kprobe attach failed: <symbol>`**

The kernel is missing the symbol the eBPF probe wants to attach to. This is
usually a kernel-config issue (e.g. CONFIG_IPV6 disabled, CONFIG_KPROBES
off, or the symbol was inlined). The legacy backend attaches to `tcp_connect`
(the common tail of both IPv4 and IPv6 connects), `inet_csk_accept`,
`udp_sendmsg`, `udpv6_sendmsg`, `ping_v4_sendmsg`, and `ping_v6_sendmsg`. The
fentry/fexit backend additionally hooks `tcp_v6_connect`.

```bash
# Check whether the failing symbol exists in the running kernel:
sudo grep '<symbol_name>' /proc/kallsyms
```

Missing `ping_v4_sendmsg` or `ping_v6_sendmsg` disables only that optional ICMP
capability. Missing TCP or UDP hooks prevents the legacy backend from providing
complete core coverage. RustNet then uses procfs if the modern backend was also
unavailable.

**4. `kernel BTF unavailable`**

Both the fentry/fexit and legacy kprobe objects use CO-RE relocations and need
usable target BTF. On stripped-down kernels (some embedded / minimal cloud
images) `/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux` and other discoverable vmlinux BTF sources may
be absent. RustNet uses procfs in that case.

```bash
ls /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux
# If missing: install the kernel-debuginfo / linux-image package matching
# your running kernel, or rebuild the kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y.
```

**5. Inside Docker / Podman**

Even with file capabilities, the *bounding* set inside the container must
contain `CAP_BPF` and `CAP_PERFMON`, or they get masked at exec:

```bash
docker run --cap-add=NET_RAW --cap-add=BPF --cap-add=PERFMON \
           --net=host --pid=host rustnet
# Optionally, if your container's seccomp profile blocks bpf(2):
#   --security-opt seccomp=unconfined
# Or if AppArmor mediates BPF:
#   --security-opt apparmor=unconfined
```

**6. `eBPF load failed: ...`**

The catch-all branch carries the raw libbpf error text. Re-run with
`RUST_LOG=debug rustnet 2>&1 | tee rustnet.log` and inspect the full
chain — it usually contains an `errno` name (`EPERM`, `EACCES`, `ENOSPC`
for memlock, etc.) that points at the root cause.

#### Windows: Npcap Not Found

- Ensure Npcap is installed from https://npcap.com/dist/
- The default Npcap settings are supported; WinPcap API-compatible mode is not required
- Verify Npcap service is running: `sc query npcap`
- Try reinstalling Npcap with administrator privileges

#### Build Errors

**Windows - Npcap SDK not found:**
- Ensure the `LIB` environment variable includes the Npcap SDK path
- Check that the SDK is extracted to a directory without spaces
- Use the correct architecture (x64 vs x86) for your Rust toolchain

**Linux build fails:**
```bash
# Install all required dependencies
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libpcap-dev libelf-dev zlib1g-dev clang llvm

# RedHat/CentOS/Fedora
sudo yum install make pkgconfig libpcap-devel elfutils-libelf-devel zlib-devel clang llvm
```

#### Windows: Graphs Display Incorrectly in PowerShell

If graphs and sparklines appear corrupted (showing question marks or garbled characters) in PowerShell, this is a **font issue**, not a RustNet bug. The default console fonts (Consolas, Lucida Console) lack support for Unicode Braille characters used for graph rendering.

**Solution:** Install a font with Unicode Braille support:

1. Download and install [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/) or any [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
2. Open PowerShell Properties (right-click title bar → Properties)
3. Select the installed font in the Font tab
4. Restart PowerShell

**Alternative:** Use [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) which has better Unicode support out of the box.

#### macOS: High Terminal CPU or Gappy Graphs (iTerm2)

RustNet's graphs are drawn with Unicode Braille characters. The classic
macOS monospace fonts (Monaco, Menlo) have no Braille glyphs, so iTerm2
renders every graph cell through font fallback. This is slow (iTerm2 can
use 10-20% CPU just displaying the graphs) and the fallback glyphs often
leave visible gaps in the waves.

**Solution:** Give iTerm2 a font with Braille coverage for non-ASCII text:

1. Install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), e.g.:

   ```bash
   brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font
   ```

2. In iTerm2: **Settings → Profiles → Text**, enable **"Use a different
   font for non-ASCII text"** and select the Nerd Font. Your regular
   text keeps its current font; only symbols and graph glyphs use the
   new one.
3. Optional: **Settings → General → Preferences → "Maximize throughput"**
   caps iTerm2's redraw rate at 30 fps, which further reduces CPU with
   frequently updating TUIs.

**Alternative:** Use a GPU-accelerated terminal such as
[WezTerm](https://wezterm.org/), [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/), or
[kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/). These render RustNet with
much lower CPU than iTerm2, and WezTerm ships JetBrains Mono with symbol
fallback built in, so the graphs render correctly with zero
configuration.

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered here:

1. Enable debug logging: `rustnet --log-level debug`
2. Check the log file in the `logs/` directory
3. Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/domcyrus/rustnet/issues) with:
   - Your operating system and version
   - Installation method used
   - Error messages from logs
   - Output of permission verification commands

### Security Best Practices

1. **Use capabilities instead of sudo** when possible (Linux)
2. **Use group-based access** instead of running as root (macOS)
3. **Regularly audit** which users have packet capture privileges
4. **Consider network segmentation** if running on production systems
5. **Monitor log files** for unauthorized usage
6. **Remove capabilities** when RustNet is no longer needed:

   ```bash
   # Linux: Remove capabilities
   sudo setcap -r /path/to/rustnet

   # macOS: Remove from group
   sudo dseditgroup -o edit -d $USER -t user access_bpf
   ```

### Integration with System Monitoring

For production environments, consider:

- **Audit logging** of packet capture access
- **Network monitoring policies** and compliance requirements
- **User access reviews** for privileged network access
- **Automated capability management** in configuration management systems

This permissions setup ensures RustNet can capture packets while maintaining security best practices and principle of least privilege.
