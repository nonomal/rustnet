## Crate Structure

RustNet is a Cargo workspace of five crates. The analysis logic, capture backend, process attribution, and sandboxing each live in their own reusable library crate; the binary composes them into the TUI application.

| Crate | Type | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`rustnet-core`](crates/rustnet-core) | library | Platform- and capture-independent analysis core: packet parsing, protocol/connection types, deep packet inspection, link-layer parsers, connection merging, DNS/GeoIP/OUI lookups, a reusable `ConnectionTracker`, and bounded retained process-activity accounting. Operates only on byte slices and parsed structures, with no libpcap, raw sockets, or OS process tables. |
| [`rustnet-capture`](crates/rustnet-capture) | library | libpcap/Npcap packet-capture backend: device selection, BPF filters, macOS PKTAP, TUN/TAP, and a raw-frame `PacketReader`. |
| [`rustnet-host`](crates/rustnet-host) | library | Per-connection process attribution plus a host TCP/UDP socket inventory: eBPF/procfs on Linux, PKTAP/lsof on macOS, ETW/IP Helper on Windows, and `sockstat` on FreeBSD. Owns the eBPF build tooling and bundled `vmlinux.h`. |
| [`rustnet-sandbox`](crates/rustnet-sandbox) | library | Post-initialization sandboxing and root privilege dropping behind one `apply_sandbox` entry point: Landlock + capability drops on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS, restricted token + job object on Windows, and the shared uid drop on Linux/macOS/FreeBSD. Depends on no other workspace crate. |
| `rustnet-monitor` (binary `rustnet`) | binary | The user-facing application: CLI, TUI, and the app event loop. Dogfoods `ConnectionTracker` as the single source of truth. |

The package is named `rustnet-monitor` because the `rustnet` crate name is taken on crates.io; the installed binary is `rustnet`.

### Dependency Graph

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    BIN[rustnet-monitor<br/>bin: rustnet]
    CAP[rustnet-capture]
    HOST[rustnet-host]
    SBX[rustnet-sandbox]
    CORE[rustnet-core]

    BIN --> CAP
    BIN --> HOST
    BIN --> SBX
    BIN --> CORE
    CAP --> CORE
    HOST --> CORE
```

The graph is acyclic: `rustnet-core` has no workspace dependencies, `rustnet-capture` and `rustnet-host` depend only on it, and `rustnet-sandbox` depends on no workspace crate at all. Keeping `rustnet-core` a leaf lets it be published and reused independently -- a headless front-end (e.g. a Prometheus exporter) can pair `rustnet-capture` + `rustnet-core` without the TUI; [`examples/headless.rs`](examples/headless.rs) shows the full pairing including `rustnet-host` and `rustnet-sandbox`.

### Re-export Facade

To keep the split internal to the binary, `src/network/mod.rs` re-exports `rustnet_core::network::*` and `rustnet_capture` (as `capture`), so existing `crate::network::*` paths, integration tests, and benches compile unchanged. The `src/network/platform` module is now just the shim wiring in `rustnet-host`'s process and socket lookup; the per-platform interface-stats providers live in `rustnet-core` behind `interface_stats::create_stats_provider`, and sandboxing plus the root uid drop live in `rustnet-sandbox`, which the binary uses directly.

## Multi-threaded Architecture

RustNet uses a multi-threaded architecture for efficient packet processing:

```

## Key Components

### 1. Packet Capture Thread

Uses libpcap to capture raw packets from the network interface. This thread runs independently and feeds packets into a Crossbeam channel for processing.

**Responsibilities:**
- Open network interface for packet capture (non-promiscuous, read-only mode)
- Apply BPF filters if needed
- Capture raw packets
- Stream packets to PCAP file if `--pcap-export` is enabled (direct disk write, no memory buffering)
- Feed parsed packets to the annotated PCAPNG writer if `--pcapng-export` is enabled (bounded best-effort queue)
- Send packets to processing queue

### 2. Packet Processors

Multiple worker threads (up to 4 by default, based on CPU cores) that parse packets and perform Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) analysis.

**Responsibilities:**
- Parse Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP headers
- Extract connection 5-tuple (protocol, src IP, src port, dst IP, dst port)
- Perform DPI to detect application protocols:
  - HTTP with host information
  - HTTPS/TLS with SNI (Server Name Indication)
  - DNS queries and responses
  - SSH connections with version detection
  - FTP control channel with commands, response codes, username, server software, and system type
  - QUIC protocol with CONNECTION_CLOSE frame detection
  - MQTT with packet types, version, and client identifier
  - BitTorrent handshakes and DHT messages
  - WireGuard and OpenVPN tunnel traffic
  - STUN for WebRTC and NAT traversal
  - NTP with version, mode, and stratum
  - mDNS and LLMNR for local name resolution
  - DHCP with message types and hostnames
  - SNMP (v1, v2c, v3) with PDU types
  - SSDP for UPnP device discovery
  - NetBIOS Name Service and Datagram Service
- Track connection states and lifecycle
- Update connection metadata in DashMap
- Calculate bandwidth metrics

### 3. Process Enrichment

Platform-specific APIs to associate network connections with running processes. This component runs periodically to enrich connection data with process information.

**Responsibilities:**
- Map socket inodes to process IDs
- Resolve process names and command lines
- Update connection records with process information
- Handle permission-related fallbacks

See [Platform-Specific Implementations](#platform-specific-implementations) for details on each platform.

### 4. Snapshot Provider

Creates consistent snapshots of connection data for the UI at regular intervals (default: 500ms). This ensures the UI has a stable view of connections without race conditions.

**Responsibilities:**
- Read from DashMap at configured intervals
- Apply filtering based on user criteria (localhost, etc.)
- Sort connections based on user-selected column
- Create immutable snapshot for UI rendering
- Provide RwLock-protected Vec<Connection> for UI thread

### 5. DNS Attribution Cache

`network::dns_attribution::DnsAttributionCache` in `rustnet-core` is an `IpAddr -> recent domains` map populated from DNS responses observed on the wire, owned by the `ConnectionTracker` (toggle via `TrackerConfig::dns_attribution`, on by default). When a connection has no SNI / Host header to identify it (encrypted QUIC after the handshake, plain TCP, fragmented ClientHello), the cache provides a hostname inferred from a DNS resolution the user just performed.

The design is **event-driven**: connections that can't be attributed at creation time (no fresh DNS yet) are enrolled into a side index keyed by their remote IP, and the eventual matching DNS response drains the waiters. There is no per-packet polling and no timer.

**Data flow:**

```
1. DNS response ──record──► IP→domains cache      IP→[ConnectionKey]
                                 ▲    │            pending waiters
                                 │    │                ▲    │
2. New connection ──attribute────┘    │                │    │ 3. drain on
      │  hit: tag attributed_hostname ◄────────────────┼──────  DNS arrival
      └─ miss: enroll ─────────────────────────────────┘

4. Cleanup thread (every sweep): cleanup_tick(now)
    ├─ prune cache entries past retention (10 min)
    └─ prune pending enrollments past the 10s freshness window

5. Connection removal: forget_pending(remote_ip, key)
```

Cache properties:

- **Freshness window**: 10s, applied symmetrically to cached `IP -> domain` entries (a connection is only attributed when the DNS response for its remote IP was observed within this window) and to pending enrollments (a new DNS resolution only attributes connections opened within this window). Matches Little Snitch's `MAX_QUERY_AGE`.
- **Retention** (cache entries): 10 minutes. Older entries are pruned but never used for attribution.
- **Cap**: 8192 IPs in the cache, up to 4 recent domains per IP, up to 256 pending waiters per IP.
- **First-write-wins** per connection: once tagged, not retagged from a later resolution to the same IP.

**Hot-path cost**: zero per-packet DNS lookups for established connections. Attribution is attempted once per connection (at creation), and again at most once per matching DNS response. Connections that already carry a hostname in the payload (checked via the unified `ApplicationProtocol::hostname()` accessor, so TLS SNI for HTTPS and QUIC plus the HTTP `Host:` header) and protocols where attribution is meaningless (DNS, mDNS, LLMNR, DHCP, SSDP, NetBIOS, ARP) short-circuit before any cache touch.

**Race safety**: `attribute()` enrolls the connection in the pending index, then re-checks the cache. If a concurrent `record_and_drain_pending()` for the same IP landed between the lookup and the enrollment, the re-check tags the connection; the now-stale enrollment is harmless and is removed by `forget_pending` when the connection is cleaned up or by the pending prune after the freshness window.

**Distinct from `network::dns::DnsResolver`**: that component performs *reverse* DNS (IP to PTR) via the system resolver; the attribution cache is *forward* DNS (domain to IPs) harvested from observed packets. The two are complementary and the UI prefers the attribution cache when both have a name.

CNAME chains need no separate map: the DNS DPI parser records the original *question* name, and the answer's A/AAAA records map directly to it. Capturing at the wire sees fewer signals than an eBPF socket-level approach (no app-to-stub traffic on `lo` unless captured, no D-Bus resolutions, no DoH/DoT plaintext); this is a known limitation.

### 6. Cleanup Thread

Removes inactive connections using smart, protocol-aware timeouts. This prevents memory leaks and keeps the connection list relevant. When `--pcap-export` is enabled, also streams connection metadata (PID, process name, timestamps) to a JSONL sidecar file as connections close.

**Timeout Strategy:**

#### TCP Connections
- **HTTP/HTTPS** (detected via DPI): **10 minutes** - supports HTTP keep-alive
- **SSH** (detected via DPI): **30 minutes** - accommodates long interactive sessions
- **Generic established**: **5 minutes**
- **TIME_WAIT**: 30 seconds - standard TCP timeout
- **CLOSED**: 15 seconds - terminal archival grace
- **SYN_SENT, FIN_WAIT, etc.**: 30-60 seconds

#### UDP Connections
- **HTTP/3 (QUIC with HTTP)**: **10 minutes** - connection reuse
- **HTTPS/3 (QUIC with HTTPS)**: **10 minutes** - connection reuse
- **SSH over UDP**: **30 minutes** - long-lived sessions
- **DNS**: **30 seconds** - short-lived queries
- **Regular UDP**: **60 seconds** - standard timeout

#### QUIC Connections (Detected State)
- **Connected**: 3 minutes default, or the peer's `max_idle_timeout` transport parameter when present
- **With CONNECTION_CLOSE frame**: 15 seconds
- **Initial/Handshaking**: 60 seconds - allow connection establishment
- **Draining/Closed**: 15 seconds - terminal archival grace

Terminal connections retain the timestamp of their first terminal state.
Repeated teardown packets update final counters without postponing archival.
When a new TCP SYN reuses a closing tuple, cleanup and packet ingestion perform
one lifecycle-safe transition: the old generation is archived immutably and a
fresh live generation is created. A bounded 30-second tombstone prevents late
TCP teardown packets from creating phantom established rows.

**Visual Staleness Indicators:**

Connections change color based on proximity to timeout:
- **White** (default): < 75% of timeout
- **Yellow**: 75-90% of timeout (warning)
- **Red**: > 90% of timeout (critical)

### 7. Rate Refresh Thread

Updates bandwidth calculations every 500ms with gentle decay. This provides smooth bandwidth visualization without abrupt changes.

**Responsibilities:**
- Calculate bytes/second for download and upload
- Apply exponential decay to older measurements
- Update visual bandwidth indicators
- Maintain rolling window of packet rates

### 8. DashMap

Concurrent hashmap (`DashMap<ConnectionKey, Connection>`) for storing connection state. This lock-free data structure enables efficient concurrent access from multiple threads.

**Key Features:**
- Fine-grained locking (per-shard)
- No global lock contention
- Safe concurrent reads and writes
- High performance under concurrent load

## Platform-Specific Implementations

### Process Lookup

RustNet uses platform-specific APIs to associate network connections with processes. On every platform, an attribution also carries a capped parent-process chain (up to four ancestors with PID, name, executable path, and start time), shown as a process tree in the Details tab and exported in JSONL.

The same backend publishes a socket snapshot every 5 seconds for the Host tab. This snapshot is independent of packet capture and therefore includes TCP LISTEN sockets and UDP BOUND endpoints that may not have emitted a packet. TCP state aggregates come from this native snapshot, while RTT remains an observed packet-derived metric. Per platform:

#### Linux

**Standard Mode (procfs):**
- Parses `/proc/net/tcp` and `/proc/net/udp` to get socket inodes
- Reads `tcp6`, `udp`, and `udp6` alongside the IPv4 tables and retains every native TCP state for the Host snapshot
- Iterates through `/proc/<pid>/fd/` to find socket file descriptors
- Maps inodes to process IDs and resolves process names from `/proc/<pid>/comm`, recovering comm-truncated names from the executable's file name
- Resolves the executable path, PPID, and UID/GID from `/proc/<pid>/`

**eBPF Mode (Default on Linux):**
- Uses kernel eBPF programs attached to socket syscalls
- Captures socket creation events with process context
- On Linux 5.11+, runs a one-shot task-file iterator after attaching the live probes to capture owners of sockets that predate RustNet, including other users' sockets in file-capability mode
- Provides lower overhead than procfs scanning
- Records the group leader's TGID, the acting TID, and credentials; the name, executable path, and PPID are enriched in user space via procfs
- **Limitations:**
  - Names originate from the 16-character kernel `comm` field; RustNet re-resolves them via `/proc/<tgid>/comm` and recovers truncated names from the executable's file name, but processes that exit before enrichment keep the short eBPF-recorded name
- **Capability requirements:**
  - Modern Linux (5.8+): `CAP_NET_RAW` (packet capture), `CAP_BPF`, `CAP_PERFMON` (eBPF)
  - Legacy Linux (pre-5.8): eBPF requires broad `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`; RustNet packages do not grant it automatically and fall back to procfs instead
  - Note: CAP_NET_ADMIN is NOT required (uses read-only, non-promiscuous packet capture)

**Fallback Behavior:**
- If the task-file iterator is unavailable, keeps the live eBPF tracker and uses the procfs startup inventory
- If the live eBPF tracker fails to load, automatically falls back to procfs mode
- TUI Statistics panel shows active detection method

#### macOS

**PKTAP Mode (with sudo):**
- Uses PKTAP (Packet Tap) kernel interface
- Extracts PID and process name directly from packet metadata
- Uses libproc to add the PPID, executable path, and effective UID/GID
- Requires root privileges (privileged kernel interface)
- Faster and more accurate than lsof

**lsof Mode (without sudo or fallback):**
- Uses `lsof -i -n -P -l` to list network connections with numeric UIDs
- Keeps the lsof socket inventory active for the Host tab even when PKTAP supplies packet process metadata
- Parses output to associate sockets with processes, then uses libproc for the
  PPID and executable path
- Higher CPU overhead but works without root
- Used automatically when PKTAP is unavailable

**Detection:**
- TUI Statistics panel shows "pktap" or "lsof" based on active method
- Automatically selects best available method

#### FreeBSD

- Uses `sockstat -s` to associate TCP and UDP sockets with processes and retain native TCP states
- Uses native `KERN_PROC_PID` and `KERN_PROC_PATHNAME` sysctl queries to add
  PPID, effective UID/GID, and executable path
- Caches process details by PID for each socket-table refresh

#### Windows

**ETW + IP Helper API:**
- Starts a real-time user trace for the kernel network and process providers
- Consumes TCP/UDP events with their process IDs, direction, and connection tuples
- Caches tuple ownership and process lifecycle metadata so short-lived processes remain attributable after exit
- Uses `GetExtendedTcpTable` and `GetExtendedUdpTable` for reconciliation, cache misses, and complete fallback when ETW cannot start
- Uses the same IP Helper owner tables as the Host socket inventory, including TCP LISTEN and all assigned UDP endpoints
- Supports TCP and UDP over both IPv4 and IPv6
- Resolves process names using lifecycle events or `OpenProcess` and `QueryFullProcessImageNameW`

**Requirements:**
- Starting the ETW session may require Administrator or **Performance Log Users** membership, subject to provider security policy
- ETW failure does not stop capture; the detection method becomes `IP Helper`, which is snapshot-based and can miss short-lived processes
- Npcap is required for packet capture, and its capture permissions are independent of ETW permissions

### Network Interfaces

The tool automatically detects and lists available network interfaces using platform-specific methods:

- **Linux**: Uses `netlink` or falls back to `/sys/class/net/`
- **macOS**: Uses `getifaddrs()` system call
- **Windows**: Uses IP Helper APIs (`GetAdaptersInfo()` for interface listing and
  `GetAdaptersAddresses()` for the parser's complete IPv4/IPv6 local-address set)
- **All platforms**: Falls back to pcap's `pcap_findalldevs()` when native methods fail

Packet endpoint orientation maintains a snapshot of the addresses currently assigned to
the host. Packet-processing workers refresh it every 30 seconds and, when neither unicast
endpoint is recognized as local, perform a rate-limited refresh and retry that packet once.
This keeps direction detection correct across DHCP changes, VPN connections, roaming, and
IPv6 privacy-address rotation. On Windows, `GetAdaptersAddresses()` supplements
`pnet_datalink`'s IPv4-only adapter data so temporary and stable IPv6 addresses are included.

### Process Activity Accounting

`ProcessActivityTracker` receives active and retained historic connections from the existing snapshot provider every 500ms. It calculates current rates, a 60-second window, peaks, retained totals, bandwidth shares, connection counts, and bounded destination summaries per process identity.

The interface-statistics collector keeps a compact 60-second counter window per interface. Activity coverage compares captured process bytes with interface bytes over that shared duration instead of dividing independently sampled instantaneous rates.

The cleanup thread already moves closed rows into `ConnectionTracker`'s historic pool, which retains up to 5,000 connections. Activity reuses that pool as its source of truth. It does not keep a second copy of full connections or run a separate sampling thread. Only compact rate histories, peaks, and the latest process snapshot remain Activity-specific. Historic overflow is folded into bounded process and destination buckets for each sample.

Activity and the connection UI are fed by the same active and historic sources. This keeps short-lived helper processes visible after exit until their historic rows are evicted or the user clears the connections.

## Performance Considerations

### Multi-threaded Processing

Packet processing is distributed across multiple threads (up to 4 by default, based on CPU cores). This enables:
- Parallel packet parsing and DPI analysis
- Better utilization of multi-core systems
- Reduced latency for high packet rates

### Concurrent Data Structures

**DashMap** provides lock-free concurrent access with:
- Per-shard locking (16 shards by default)
- No global lock contention
- Read-heavy workload optimization
- Safe concurrent modifications

### Batch Processing

Packets are processed in batches to improve cache efficiency:
- Multiple packets processed before context switching
- Reduced system call overhead
- Better CPU cache utilization

### Selective DPI

Deep packet inspection can be disabled with `--no-dpi` for lower overhead:
- Reduces CPU usage by 20-40% on high-traffic networks
- Still tracks basic connection information
- Useful for performance-constrained environments

### Configurable Intervals

Adjust refresh rates based on your needs:
- **UI refresh**: Default 500ms (adjustable with `--refresh-interval`)
- **Process enrichment**: Every 2 seconds
- **Cleanup check**: Every 5 seconds
- **Rate calculation**: Every 500ms

### Memory Management

**Connection cleanup** prevents unbounded memory growth:
- Protocol-aware timeouts remove stale connections
- Visual staleness warnings before removal
- Configurable timeout thresholds

**Snapshot isolation** prevents UI blocking:
- UI reads from immutable snapshots
- Background threads update DashMap concurrently
- No lock contention between UI and packet processing

## Dependencies

RustNet is built with the following key dependencies:

### Core Dependencies

## Embedded Data Files

RustNet embeds static lookup databases at compile time, avoiding runtime file dependencies. Both follow the same pattern: embed the file, parse into a `HashMap` at startup, expose a `lookup()` method.

### Service Lookup (`crates/rustnet-core/assets/services`)

Port-to-service-name mappings (e.g., 80/tcp -> http). Loaded by `ServiceLookup` in `crates/rustnet-core/src/network/services.rs` using `include_str!`.

### OUI Vendor Database (`crates/rustnet-core/assets/oui.gz`)

IEEE MA-L OUI prefix-to-vendor mappings for MAC address vendor resolution (e.g., `00:1B:63` -> Apple). Gzip-compressed to reduce binary size (~400KB compressed vs ~1.2MB raw). Decompressed at startup by `OuiLookup` in `crates/rustnet-core/src/network/oui.rs` using `include_bytes!` + `flate2`. Used for ARP connections and for the Local/Remote MAC rows in the Details tab, which are backed by a neighbor cache (`crates/rustnet-core/src/network/neighbors.rs`) that passively learns IP-to-MAC mappings from observed ARP (IPv4) and NDP (IPv6) traffic. ARP never crosses a router, and NDP messages are trusted only at hop limit 255 — which proves they were not routed (RFC 4861) — with fragmented NDP ignored entirely (RFC 6980), so the cache only ever labels on-link addresses (LAN devices and the gateway), never public remotes.

A GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/update-oui.yml`) updates this file monthly from the [IEEE public database](https://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui/oui.txt) and opens a PR if there are changes.

## Comparison with Similar Tools

Network monitoring tools exist on a spectrum from simple connection listing to full packet forensics:

```
Simple ←─────────────────────────────────────────────────────→ Complex

netstat     iftop     bandwhich     RustNet     tcpdump     Wireshark
   │          │           │            │            │            │

```

**RustNet's position**: Real-time connection monitoring with DPI and process identification - more capable than bandwidth monitors, more focused than forensic capture tools.

### Choosing the Right Tool

| Your Goal | Best Tool |
|-----------|-----------|
| See which process is making a connection | RustNet |
| Decode packets byte-by-byte | Wireshark |
| Monitor connection states (SYN_SENT, ESTABLISHED, etc.) | RustNet |
| Extract files or credentials from traffic | Wireshark |
| Attribute network activity to specific applications | RustNet |
| Deep protocol dissection (3000+ protocols) | Wireshark |
| Quick terminal-based network overview | RustNet |
| Save captures with process attribution | RustNet (`--pcap-export` or `--pcapng-export`) |
| Save captures for deep analysis | Wireshark/tcpdump |

### RustNet and Wireshark: Different Strengths

The key difference: **RustNet knows which process owns each connection. Wireshark cannot.**

Wireshark operates at the packet capture layer (libpcap) - it sees raw network traffic but has no visibility into which application created it. RustNet combines packet capture with OS-level socket introspection (via eBPF on Linux, /proc, or platform APIs) to attribute every connection to its owning process.

| Capability | RustNet | Wireshark |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| Process identification | Yes (eBPF, procfs, platform APIs) | No |
| Connection state tracking | Native (TCP FSM, QUIC states) | Via dissectors |
| Protocol dissectors | ~15 common protocols | 3000+ protocols |
| Packet-level inspection | Metadata only | Full payload |
| Interface | TUI (terminal) | GUI |
| Capture to file | Yes (`--pcap-export`) | Yes (native) |

Both tools can run in real-time. Choose based on what you need to see:
- **"What is making this connection?"** → RustNet
- **"What's inside this packet?"** → Wireshark

### Bridging the Gap: PCAP Export with Process Attribution

RustNet can now export packet captures while preserving process attribution - something neither tcpdump nor Wireshark can do alone:

```bash
# Capture packets with RustNet (includes process tracking)
sudo rustnet -i eth0 --pcap-export capture.pcap

# Creates:
#   capture.pcap                    - Standard PCAP file
#   capture.pcap.connections.jsonl  - Process attribution (PID, name, timestamps)

# Or write an annotated PCAPNG directly during live capture
sudo rustnet -i eth0 --pcapng-export annotated.pcapng

# Or enrich a classic PCAP after capture
python scripts/pcap_enrich.py capture.pcap -o enriched.pcapng

# Open in Wireshark - packets now show process info in comments
wireshark annotated.pcapng
```

This workflow gives you the best of both worlds:
- **RustNet's process attribution**: Know which application generated each packet
- **Wireshark's deep analysis**: Full protocol dissection with 3000+ analyzers

Native PCAPNG export embeds live best-effort packet comments directly. The enrichment script remains useful when cleanup-time sidecar metadata completeness is more important than producing a single file during capture.

See [USAGE.md - PCAP Export](USAGE.md#pcap-export) for detailed documentation.
